Exercise 1.3
//In code files
if ( a > b) a is in it
	if (b > c) b is in it
		c is in it
if ( a < b) b is in it
	if (a > c) a is in it
		c is in it

Exercise 1.4
If b is greater than 0, we return the operator + since we are adding a to the absolute value
of b. Clearly if b is positive, we just add whatever a is to it.
Now if b is not greater than 0, we must return the operator -. since we are adding absolute value
we must cancel out the negative, and we all know that a - (- b ) == a + b. 

Exercise 1.5
For an applicative-order evaluation the code will never run. Since (p) will constantly call itself we never get to the call of test.
For a normal-order evaluation we will call test. But then get stuck.
